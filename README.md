# jitsi-bubble
A simple web interface for conference call with Jitsi

This project is a fork of https://github.com/maxired/jitsi-standup.

## Why bubbles?

Circle packs more efficiently than squares, and circle-packing it's a cool topic I wanted to play with.
Plus circle-packing configurations seems more pleasant/natural/degrade bettern than rectangle packing.

We seems to be moving to a circle based icons / profile pictures (think Twitter, Linkedin, etc), so why not use it while conferencing. As a bonus, you will get to keep the real important part of the video feed (usually), allowing so to have more pixel.

## Why Jitsi?

Jitsi was the simpler to hack toghether, + I had found a starting point here: https://github.com/maxired/jitsi-standup.

## Can I add bubble-based conferencing to XXXX?

Sure. I would be curious to see want you come up with.
